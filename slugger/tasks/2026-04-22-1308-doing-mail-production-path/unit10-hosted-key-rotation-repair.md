# Unit 10 Hosted Key Rotation Repair

Started: 2026-04-23 04:36 PDT

## Why This Exists

Live hosted setup exposed a recovery gap before the final mail smoke could proceed.

`ouro account ensure --agent slugger --owner-email ari@mendelow.me --source hey` correctly called hosted Mail Control, but the hosted registry already referenced public mail key ids whose matching private keys were not present in Slugger's vault runtime config.

The harness failed before writing partial config:

```text
hosted Mail Control references private mail key mail_slugger-native_6e4d749b49ae4bb9, but it was not returned and is not present in slugger's vault runtime/config. Repair requires a fresh Mail Control one-time key response or key rotation.
```

That detection was good. The missing production piece was a safe way for hosted Mail Control to rotate future mailbox/source public keys and return fresh one-time private keys for the owning agent vault.

## Invariant

- Mail Control stores public registry records only.
- Mail Control returns newly generated private keys exactly once.
- Private mail keys live in the owning agent vault runtime config.
- Rotation repairs future mail access.
- Rotation cannot decrypt mail already encrypted to a lost private key.
- Native `slugger@ouro.bot` and delegated `me.mendelow.ari.slugger@ouro.bot` keys may be rotated independently.

## Substrate Patch

Branch: `slugger/hosted-mail-key-rotation-repair`

Commits so far:

- `28b88fd test(mail): cover hosted key rotation recovery`
- `cf832ea feat(mail): add hosted key rotation recovery`
- `a9dd828 test(mail): cover rotation store failures`
- `c0459bf test(mail): cover hosted rotation edge cases`

Implemented:

- Shared protocol helper `rotatePublicMailboxRegistryKeys`.
- `MailRegistryStore.rotateMailboxKeys` with file and Azure store implementations.
- Mail Control `POST /v1/mailboxes/rotate-keys`.
- Admin-token protection matching ensure.
- Request flags `rotateMailbox`, `rotateSourceGrant`, optional `reason`.
- Response shape with public records plus one-time `generatedPrivateKeys`.
- Body-safe logs for `mailbox_keys_rotated`.
- Operations and recovery docs naming the endpoint and the lost-prior-mail limitation.

## Harness Patch

Branch: `slugger/hosted-mail-key-rotation-repair`

Commits so far:

- `f7626a8b test(mail): cover hosted key rotation repair`
- `255d8b61 feat(mail): rotate missing hosted mail keys`
- `8e25ba60 test(mail): cover hosted rotation recovery branches`
- `82ac816c chore(release): bump harness to alpha.471`

Implemented:

- `--rotate-missing-mail-keys` on `ouro account ensure` and `ouro connect mail`.
- Hosted setup now detects missing mailbox/source key ids after Mail Control ensure.
- With the explicit flag, harness calls `/v1/mailboxes/rotate-keys` and stores only the fresh one-time keys returned by Mail Control.
- Without the flag, harness fails with actor-runnable recovery guidance and does not write partial runtime config.
- Docs teach the flag and warn that lost prior private keys cannot decrypt already-stored mail.
- Release metadata bumped to `0.1.0-alpha.471` for npm publish/install.

## Next Steps

1. Push both branches and open PRs.
2. Merge/deploy substrate first so the hosted rotation endpoint exists in production.
3. Merge/publish/install harness `0.1.0-alpha.471`.
4. Run:

```text
ouro account ensure --agent slugger --owner-email ari@mendelow.me --source hey --rotate-missing-mail-keys
```

5. Verify Slugger runtime config has hosted Blob coordinates, native and delegated aliases, and fresh private key ids without printing private key material.
6. Resume live smoke: native inbound, delegated HEY backfill/forwarding, outbound provider/events, and Outlook audit.

## Live Progress

Update written during the 2026-04-23 production run after the rotation repair shipped.

Completed:

- Substrate PR #21 merged, deployed, and left Mail Control healthy with hosted key rotation available.
- Harness PR #592 merged, published `0.1.0-alpha.471`, installed globally, and made `--rotate-missing-mail-keys` available to `ouro account ensure`.
- Live repair command succeeded for Slugger without printing secret key material:

```text
ouro account ensure --agent slugger --owner-email ari@mendelow.me --source hey --rotate-missing-mail-keys
```

- Slugger runtime config now points at the hosted Blob store and contains current native plus delegated private key ids.
- Re-running account ensure without the rotation flag is idempotent.

New production finding:

- The first live native SMTP smoke after rotation was accepted by `mail-ingress`, but the stored message was encrypted to the old missing native key id `mail_slugger-native_6e4d749b49ae4bb9`.
- That means hosted Mail Ingress could keep a stale Azure registry cache across rotation and continue encrypting future mail to lost public keys.
- The harness mailbox reader also treated one undecryptable historic/stale-key record as fatal for the whole mailbox search.

Follow-up fixes now in flight:

- Substrate branch `slugger/mail-registry-cache-and-decrypt-recovery` makes Azure Blob registry reads fresh by default (`--registry-refresh-ms 0`) and documents cache opt-in as unsafe without an invalidation plan.
- Harness branch `slugger/mail-missing-key-reader-recovery` makes `mail_recent`, `mail_search`, and `mail_thread` keep working around missing old private keys while returning body-safe recovery warnings. It still throws on non-missing-key decrypt corruption.

Current verification:

```text
# substrate
npx vitest run apps/mail-ingress/src/__tests__/registry.test.ts apps/mail-ingress/src/__tests__/args.test.ts
npm run ci:local

# harness
npx vitest run src/__tests__/mailroom/tools-mail.test.ts
npm run test:coverage
```

Do not rotate keys again as a cache-invalidation strategy. The correct production fix is fresh registry reads or explicit cache invalidation before accepting mail after rotation. Old mail already encrypted to a lost key remains unrecoverable unless the old private key can be restored from the owning agent vault.
