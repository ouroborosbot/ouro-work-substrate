## Still Not Claimed

This evidence proves the Unit 5 code/docs/coverage/release/deploy lane. It does not claim:

- Slugger has completed the HEY browser login/export/forwarding-confirmation flow.
- Ari's historical HEY export has been imported.
- Future HEY forwarding has been observed at `me.mendelow.ari.slugger@ouro.bot`.
- Native autonomous outbound mail is production-ready.
